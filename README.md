# OpenCV_AI_Virtual_keyboard
Created a virtual keyboard using OpenCV and hand tracking, enabling touch-free typing by detecting hand gestures. The app features real-time key simulation with pyautogui, 
dynamic text display, and audio feedback via Pygame. Custom features include key color changes and accurate text input when both index and middle fingers are detected together.
